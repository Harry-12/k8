> What is a namespace in k8?

Namespaces are Kubernetes objects which partition a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. Each Kubernetes namespace provides the scope for Kubernetes Names it contains; which means that using the combination of an object name and a Namespace, each object gets an unique identity across the cluster.
